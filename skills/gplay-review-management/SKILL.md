  | while read REVIEW_ID; do
    echo "Replying to review: $REVIEW_ID"

echo "=== Review Dashboard ==="
echo ""

# Total reviews
TOTAL=$(gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE --paginate | jq '.reviews | length')
echo "Total reviews: $TOTAL"

echo ""
echo "Rating distribution:"
gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE --paginate \
  | jq -r '.reviews[] | .rating' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Avg rating
AVG=$(gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE --paginate \
  | jq '[.reviews[].rating] | add / length')
echo ""
echo "Average rating: $AVG"

# Unreplied reviews
UNREPLIED=$(gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE --paginate \
  | jq '[.reviews[] | select(.comments | length == 1)] | length')
echo ""
echo "Unreplied reviews: $UNREPLIED"

# Recent 1-star
echo ""
echo "Recent 1-star reviews:"
gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE \
  | jq -r '.reviews[] | select(.rating == 1) | "\(.comments[0].userComment.lastModified.time): \(.comments[0].userComment.text)"' \
  | head -5
```

UNREPLIED=$(gplay reviews list --package $PACKAGE \
  | jq '[.reviews[] | select(.rating <= 2 and (.comments | length == 1))] | length')

if [ "$UNREPLIED" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  You have $UNREPLIED unreplied negative reviews!"
  # Send notification (email, Slack, etc.)
fi
```

# Get reviews mentioning "support" or "help"
gplay reviews list --package com.example.app --paginate \
  | jq -r '.reviews[] | select(.comments[0].userComment.text | test("support|help"; "i")) |
    "Review ID: \(.reviewId)\nRating: \(.rating)\nText: \(.comments[0].userComment.text)\n---"' \
